A Scraper built using Python for my College LMS(Learning Managment System). 

Requirements:

1. Username and password (these fields are empty in the lms.py file)
2. Course id (currently it has a list of course id of 1st semester)

What it Does:
It logs in to the account, checks for assignments that have to be submitted.
Then it creates a txt file in the current folder and lists all the assignments whose submission date is yet to come.
