This is a scraper for my college Learning Management System.
Before you run the program, you need to fill in your Roll number and password.
This was made for the 1st year courses. 
In case you want it to use for any other year courses, you need the id's of your courses, which you can find simply by clicking on the course and inspecting the element.
Enter the course id in the list subjects. Also fill your rolll number and passsword in the lms.py file
