# A Simple Scraper

For those of you wondering what LMS is, my college has a portal called Learning Management System where you can find all the assignments that you have to submit, study materials, lecture presentations of your Courses.

What this Scraper does is it logs into your account, scrapes all info about the assignments that has to be Submitted.
